# Recall Instantly!!

## How it works

- Create a folder
- Dump text and image files of things you need to recall here
- The filename should of each file is a comma-separated list of tags
  e.g. 'math, polynomials.jpg', 'lisp, printing symbols.txt'
- Run this command in the directory, with the tags you need to recall as arguments
  e.g. `recall lisp`, `recall algebra polynomials logarithms`

Files with tags included in their names will be opened either in your default browser
or an associated program (depending on your OS)
